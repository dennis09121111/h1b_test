Suppose the input files are a semicolon separated (";") format
It seems Python do not support xlsx read if no other external libraries are allowed

This program is to find the Top 10 Occupations and Top 10 States for certified visa applications (H1B)

run run.sh to process the program, use `./run.sh`

```
python ./src/h1b_counting.py ./input/h1b_input.csv ./output/top_10_occupations.txt ./output/top_10_states.txt
```

if you have a different csv file, change the `./input/h1b_input.csv` to your new file dir
